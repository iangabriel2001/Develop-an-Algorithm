## üìù Example Code

```python
# Approved users and devices
approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]
approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

# Define login function
def login(username, device_id):
    if username in approved_users:
        print("The user", username, "is approved to access the system.")
        ind = approved_users.index(username)
        if device_id == approved_devices[ind]:
            print(device_id, "is the assigned device for", username)
        else:
            print(device_id, "is not their assigned device.")
    else:
        print("The username", username, "is not approved to access the system.")

# Example calls
login("sgilmore", "4n482ts")   # Approved, correct device
login("sgilmore", "hl0s5o1")   # Approved, wrong device
login("not_a_user", "random1") # Not approved
